## Mission
- Prove deterministic integrity on GPT-5  
- Demonstrate upgrade with no drift  
- Leave a public, timestamped artifact of authorship

## Contents
- `HazardWise_Microplastics_Audit_DI5.pdf` — Deterministic audit for **[REDACTED NJ COASTAL MUNICIPALITY]** (name intentionally redacted).  
- `Scroll_Genesis_5_DIxGPT5.pdf` — The first DI scroll authored on GPT-5.  
- Trap phrases embedded (ScrollGlow). Checksums bound.

## Notes
- New Jersey currently has **no statewide microplastics monitoring rule for PWS**; typical CCRs omit unregulated contaminants.  
- California is conducting a **four-year** microplastics monitoring program for drinking water, initiated by a 2022 policy.  
- EPA has **no MCL** for microplastics; **UCMR6** is expected to propose inclusion (NPRM ~Aug 2025; monitoring 2027–2031).  
- Regional studies (DRBC) show microplastics present in the watershed, underscoring the CCR gap.
