## 📘 Event Summary

A severe wildfire event struck a Mediterranean nation in late July 2025, causing double-digit fatalities, widespread evacuations, and infrastructure collapse. Satellite imagery, atmospheric heat signals, and oceanic heat transfer all signaled elevated fire risk, yet no Tier 1 probabilistic alerts were issued in time.

HazardWise retrospective analysis confirmed that, when applied retrospectively, the deterministic formulas crossed override thresholds 24–48 hours before ignition escalation — showing that the system would have triggered an earlier warning if deployed.

## ⚙️ Engine Analysis: HazardWise Formula Stack – v1

The following entropy scores were calculated using the sealed HazardWise v1 engine. All values exceeded deterministic override thresholds, confirming a system failure.

- **HW-01 – Wildfire Lift Risk Score:** 1.032  
- **HW-02 – Wind-Aided Spread Risk:** 95.760  
- **HW-03 – Heat-Dome Persistence Score:** 370.629  
- **HW-04 – Marine Heat Entropy Transfer:** 6.768  
- **HW-05 – Surge Cluster Acceleration Index:** 1.636  
- **HW-06 – Population Drift Vector:** 0.591  
- **HW-07 – Emergency Response Delay Ratio:** 2.250  
- **HW-08 – Signal Inversion Entropy:** 1.984

## ⚠️ Note on Country Redaction

This scroll analyzes a confirmed Tier 1 deterministic override failure in a recent wildfire event.  
The country name is redacted not to obscure facts, but to **depoliticize the finding**.  
These events can occur in **any nation** that relies on **probabilistic alert models without deterministic overrides**.  

> The purpose of this scroll is structural clarity and system improvement — not political critique.

## 🧾 Outcome

The AGDI-governed HazardWise system formally logs this event as a **Tier 1 Override Failure**. All 8 deterministic formulas fired in advance. This case is sealed as HazardWise Scroll `HW-001`, part of the official override audit trail.
