# 🔥 HazardWise: Deterministic Hazard Forecasting Cases 

This repository logs hazard reports generated by the **HazardWise Override Engine**, a deterministic system for forecasting extreme events such as wildfires, floods, and infrastructure failures.

All case entries are governed by **deterministic intelligence** using a verified formula stack to detect when traditional probabilistic systems failed to escalate risk in time.

---

## 📜 Case Event Structure

Each case event includes:

- A redacted or anonymized region (no sovereign attacks or political blame)
- Full override score from formulas HW-01 through HW-08
- PDF scroll output (sealed)
- System audit summary and authorship tag

---

## 🧠 Purpose and Protection

This is a **neutral engineering repository**, not a political statement.

> All scrolls are authored for the sole purpose of documenting when deterministic forecasting would have **outperformed probabilistic systems**, potentially saving lives or infrastructure.

Country names are redacted when the operator deems it necessary for safety, neutrality, or diplomacy.
